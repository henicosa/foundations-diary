A research question is the question around which you center your research. It should be:
1. **clear**: it provides enough specifics that one’s audience can easily understand its purpose without needing additional explanation.
2. **focused**: it is narrow enough that it can be answered thoroughly in the space the writing task allows.
3. **concise**: it is expressed in the fewest possible words.
4. **complex**: it is not answerable with a simple “yes” or “no,” but rather requires synthesis and analysis of ideas and sources prior to composition of an answer.
5. **arguable**: its potential answers are open to debate rather than accepted facts.
