*Abstract: This paper presents a new conceptual approach to institutional governance, management, and leadership based upon a cybernetic model of organizations. The cybernetic paradigm integrates existing models by suggesting how bureaucratic,  
collegial, political, and anarchical subsystems function simultaneously in colleges and ==universities== of all kinds to create ==self-correcting institutions==. The cybernetic paradigm posits that organization control systems can be described in terms of sensing mechanisms and negative feedback loops that collectively monitor changes from acceptable levels of functioning and that activate forces that return institutions to their previous stable state. These self correcting (cybernetic) processes function as institutional “thermostats”. Administrators can function effectively by adopting leadership and management approaches that are consistent with cybernetic principles. These principles suggest that administrators should complicate themselves and use multiple frames to develop richer behavioral repertoires, increase the sensitivity of institutional monitoring systems, and focus attention on important issues through systems that report data and create forums for interaction. The major function of the cybernetic administrator is to coordinate and balance the various systems within the institution to move towards optimizing the administrator’s values. This can be done by making incremental adjustments to administrative processes and procedures, by enunciating goals that establish constraints, and by emphasizing selected elements of organizational life.*

Birnbaum maps the concepts of cybernetic thinking to a fictional university institution: **Huxley College**. (p. 240)

> A thermostat is an example of a self-correcting, cybernetic control system with a feedback loop. It turns the furnace on when the environment's temperature falls below a pre-set limit (say, 70~ and turns it off when the temperature returns to the desired level. This keeps the temperature within an acceptable range. In the same way, Huxley has a number of goals whose achievement must fall within an area of acceptability.
> If any of them fall outside that range, the energies of individuals or groups at the college are activated in an attempt to return Huxley to the desired level. (p. 241)

Birnbaum divides between explicit and implicit controls. Their first function is to keep operations in the university in the acceptable limits by using minor adjustments. The second function is that the minor adjustments initiate actions to inform that something goes wrong. ==Maybe connected to [[Nudging]]== (p. 242)
(Reference to [[Ashby_1960]])

Possible strategies:
- Avoid ultimate organizational objectives by defining subgoals
	- ==What about a shared vision to motivate everyone?==
- Keyword: **Bounded Rationality** means to only focus on the Relevant Aspects (Reference: to Simon 1958 and Simon 1961).
	- ==Maybe connected to the [[Frame Problem]]==
