# Select 8
- Select at least 8 items from your initial review to study in more detail.
- Strategies:
	- Skim all items from part 1 to identify the most relevant.
	- Your choices should be diverse. Aim for a variety of authors, distinct and opposing viewpoints.
	- Primary sources are preferable. Secondary sources if they add a significant new idea.
	- At least 75% academic.

# Deep Read
- With the selections, perform a deep read while taking notes. Aim for 200-500 words for each.
- Strategies:
	- Highlight PDFs and take notes in a text editor.
	- Focus on key points to get an overview of the paper. Look for one main point per paragraph.
	- Distinguish between your summary, quotations, and your own thoughts (could use () or \[\]).
	- Note page numbers as you take notes.
	- Copy specific quotes that are inspiring, crucial or provide a neat summary

- See an [Annotated Bibliography Overview](https://spark.library.yorku.ca/wp-content/themes/glendonits-spark-20151125/resources/Annotated%20Bibliography%20Overview.pdf) from Yorkâ€™s [SPARK](https://spark.library.yorku.ca/) (Student Papers & Academic Research Kit)
- Some point based style summaries are fine with me.

# After Completion
- After completing your notes on each paper, reread the paper looking for potential mistakes or misunderstandings. Add any new thoughts you might have.
- i.e. edit your notes well!

# Post to your journal:
- The specific topic title or the keywords or search terms
- The research question/problem statement/abstract
- Your annotated bibliography
- Any meta-commentary on observations you found while researching the topic that are not specific to any one paper -- in particular, did you find a "gap" in the treatment of the topic that could be an important avenue for your own work?
