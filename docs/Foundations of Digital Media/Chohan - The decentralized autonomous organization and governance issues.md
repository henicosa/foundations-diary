*Abstract: The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) represents an innovation in the design of organizations, in its emphasis on computerized rules and contracts, but the DAO’s structures and functions also raise issues of governance. This discussion paper enumerates those issues, so as to encourage further research on DAOs and governance.*

## government by algorithm

Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) as a digital structure for the execution of preset protocols, proceeding from the innovations of blockchain technology to situate a technology in the contractual sphere.

>  A DAO, is an organization that is run through rules encoded as computer programs called “smart contracts.” In other words, it is “governance” by pre-programmed algorithms that are executed by computers based on code.

The original DAO was intended as an investor-driven venture capital fund, which would disburse funds based on voting patterns of “investors,” based on proposals that would be submitted by participant “contractors” and vetted by nominated “curators.” It would not be a vehicle for holding  
money per se, but rather would serve as a democratically-structured and transparent virtual platform for competition among proposals made by contractors.
