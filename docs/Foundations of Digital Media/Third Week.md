## What is research?
- research is built on sharing "Stand on the shoulders of giants" (Google Scholar)
- asking a new question and demonstrating it is worth answering
- respond to the question and show the response is sound
- Notice what you are noticing and notice what you are not noticing
- how can we know what we don't know

### Developing a research question
- something that you are passionate about. What are you curious about? Can you contribute an original idea or independent perspective?
