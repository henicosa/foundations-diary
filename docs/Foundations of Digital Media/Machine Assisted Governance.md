## Cybernetics

**Birnbaum: The cybernetic institution: Toward an integration of governance theories**
Robert Birnbaum. “[The cybernetic institution: Toward an integration of governance](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00139183) theories”. In: Higher Education 18.2 (1989),  
pp. 239–253.  
*Abstract: This paper presents a new conceptual approach to institutional governance, management, and leadership based upon a cybernetic model of organizations. The cybernetic paradigm integrates existing models by suggesting how bureaucratic,  
collegial, political, and anarchical subsystems function simultaneously in colleges and ==universities== of all kinds to create ==self-correcting institutions==. The cybernetic paradigm posits that organization control systems can be described in terms of sensing mechanisms and negative feedback loops that collectively monitor changes from acceptable levels of functioning and that activate forces that return institutions to their previous stable state. These self correcting (cybernetic) processes function as institutional “thermostats”. Administrators can function effectively by adopting leadership and management approaches that are consistent with cybernetic principles. These principles suggest that administrators should complicate themselves and use multiple frames to develop richer behavioral repertoires, increase the sensitivity of institutional monitoring systems, and focus attention on important issues through systems that report data and create forums for interaction. The major function of the cybernetic administrator is to coordinate and balance the various systems within the institution to move towards optimizing the administrator’s values. This can be done by making incremental adjustments to administrative processes and procedures, by enunciating goals that establish constraints, and by emphasizing selected elements of organizational life.*

**Chohan: The decentralized autonomous organization and governance issues**
Usman W Chohan. “[The decentralized autonomous organization and governance issues](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3082055)”. In: Available at SSRN 3082055 (2017).  
*Abstract: The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) represents an innovation in the design of organizations, in its emphasis on computerized rules and contracts, but the DAO’s structures and functions also raise issues of governance. This discussion paper enumerates those issues, so as to encourage further research on DAOs and governance.*

**Clement-Okooboh et al.: Applying cybernetic thinking to becoming a learning organization** 
Kesiena Mercy Clement-Okooboh and Bill Olivier. “[Applying cybernetic thinking to becoming a learning organization](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Applying-cybernetic-thinking-to-becoming-a-learning-Clement-Okooboh-Olivier/5acba1765e59eea13cb00d1ea655a2493e924fe0)”. In: Kybernetes (2014).  
*Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to provide a case study of the application of cybernetic thinking by the learning and development unit in a national branch of a large multinational company to help move towards its strategic objective of becoming a learning organization.*

**Nechansky: Elements of a cybernetic epistemology: decisions, control and principles of societal organization**   
Helmut Nechansky. “[Elements of a cybernetic epistemology: decisions, control and principles of societal organization]()”. In: Kybernetes (2008).  
*Abstract: The interaction of goal-oriented systems can lead directly to conflict, cooperation or hierarchy. Out of conflict and cooperation there is a further tendency to develop hierarchies. And in a diversifying environment a hierarchical higher system can grow, get suppressive or perish. It is shown how all this abstract cybernetic reasoning applies to societal organization, too: laws follow the form of decision-rules of feedback systems. Institutions making laws have to define the elements of such decision-rules. And societal organization processes for solving conflicts face exactly the options derived from the interaction of goal-oriented systems.*

## Positive Psychology

**Seligman: Flourish : a visionary new understanding of happiness and well-being** 
Martin E. P. Seligman. Flourish : a visionary new understanding of happiness and well-being. eng. 1st Free Press hardcover ed. New York: Free Press, 2011. ISBN: 9781439190777.  
*Abstract: Flourish builds on Dr. Seligman’s game-changing work on optimism, motivation, and character to show how to get the most out of life, unveiling an electrifying new theory of what makes a good life — for individuals, for communities, and for nations.  
In a fascinating evolution of thought and practice, Flourish refines what Positive Psychology is all about. While certainly a part of well-being, happiness alone doesn’t give life meaning. Seligman now asks, What is it that enables you to cultivate your talents, to build deep, lasting relationships with others, to feel pleasure, and to contribute meaningfully to the world? In a word, what is it that allows you to flourish? “Well-being” takes the stage front and center, and Happiness (or Positive Emotion) becomes one of the five pillars of Positive Psychology, along with Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment—or PERMA, the permanent building blocks for a life of profound fulfillment.*

## Design

**Senova: This human : how to be the person designing for other people** 
Melis Senova. This human : how to be the person designing for other people. eng. Amsterdam, The Netherlands: BIS publishers, 2017. ISBN: 9789063694609.  
*Abstract: There are many great design books in existence that teach us about design process, tools and methods. With the increasing popularity of design thinking and human-centred design we’ve also seen more material discussing various aspects  
of the practice. One missing aspect, almost in an ironic twist, is what it takes to be the actual person who is doing the designing.  
The name ’This Human’ is referring to that person. The person who needs to observe to gain insight, to makes sense of their observations in a way that isn’t biased by their own world views. The person who needs to communicate in many different ways with many different intentions to communicate information which is often hard to access, difficult to grasp and just not that tangible. 
The person who is so passionate about having a positive impact they become exhausted one third of the way into their project. This book helps these people to learn more about themselves and how to think and be in their practice of design-to help them grasp all that is going on inside that then influences their creations.*

**Dewett et al.: The role of information technology in the organization: a review, model, and assessment** 
Todd Dewett and Gareth R Jones. “[The role of information technology in the organization: a review, model, and assessment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149206301000940)”. In: Journal of Management 27.3 (2001), pp. 313–346. ISSN: 0149-2063. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0149-2063(01)00094-0
*Abstract: This paper reviews and extends recent scholarly and popular literature to provide a broad overview of how information technology (IT) impacts organizational characteristics and outcomes. First, based on a review of the literature, we describe two of the principal performance enhancing benefits of IT: information efficiencies and information synergies, and identify five main organizational outcomes of the application of IT that embody these benefits. We then discuss the role that IT plays in moderating the relationship between organizational characteristics including structure, size, learning, culture, and interorganizational relationships and the most strategic outcomes, organizational efficiency and innovation. Throughout we discuss the limitations and possible negative consequences of the use of IT and close by considering several key areas for future research.*

**IVANOV: VALUES-BASED BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION–THE CASE OF ECOSIA AND ITS BUSINESS MODEL**  
doi:10.1142/S1363919622400023  
KIRIL IVANOV. “VALUES-BASED BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION–THE CASE OF ECOSIA AND ITS BUSINESS MODEL”.  
In: International Journal of Innovation Management 0.0 (0), p. 2240002. eprint: https://doi.org/10.1142/S1363919622400023.  
URL: https://doi.org/10.1142/S1363919622400023.  
*Abstract: This paper explores how values-based innovation (VBI) management can facilitate the development of business models and their constitutive components. It analyses the case of the green search engine, Ecosia, to demonstrate and further differentiate the theoretical framework of VBI management. According to the VBI management framework, the development of sustainable business models cannot be appropriately managed and researched without considering values and normative orientations. Ecosia’s case highlights that the continuous reconsideration and negotiation of values is integral to the management of business model innovation (BMI) and contributes to the development and specification of business model components.  
Thus, the case confirms and contributes to a more in-depth understanding of the role values play in managing innovation and demonstrates some of the challenges encountered in the daily practice of VBI management.*
