# Information Flows in PKB
When publishing the Knowledge Base on a website, the notetaker (**sender**) exposes the information contained in the knowledge base to an arbitrary reader (**receiver**).

### Subjects

### Attributes

### Transmission Principles
- The goal is to preserve the transmission principle of the original information flow that brought the information to the knowledge base in the first place.

# Privacy-preserving approaches
## Text
	- pseudonyms
## Image/Video
	- blurring
## Audio 
	- text-to-speech
	- Audio effects

all these approaches only work for explicit mentioning

> *â€œIt is my thesis that privacy is not just one possible means among others to insure some other value, but that it is necessarily related to ends and relations of the most fundamental sort: respect, love, friendship and trust. Privacy is not merely a good technique for furthering these fundamental relations; rather without privacy they are simply inconceivable."*

Thoughts on Legal Considerations}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\textit{
Outlining how law might integrate with the identified dimensions}

\par \textit{differ between privacy and property rights and how they might come together}
\par \textit{reference the German law "right to one's own person" and the exceptions}

\paragraph{Spheres of personality rights} Personality rights in Germany are ordered in different spheres: Core private sphere for the intimate life that can't be diminished in favor of other interests. Private Sphere that covers intimate social relations with others. Therefore interests of third parties can be taken into account by a court. This is the sphere of interpersonal information. And social sphere that further includes less intimate relations with others. \footnote{\href{https://www.taylorwessing.com/synapse/article_germanpersonalityrights.html}{Taylor Wessing}}

\paragraph{Informational self-determination} In German Law exists the concept of informational self-determination that guarantees ''the authority of the individual to decide himself, on the basis of the idea of self-determination, when and within what limits information about his private life should be communicated to others.''\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informational_self-determination}{Wikipedia: Informational Self Determination}} This law still applies when a fiduciary publishes the information like in our example.

\paragraph{Netzdurchsetzungsgesetz} ... regulates intermediaries to protect the privacy of third parties in the internet. Originally designed for service providers like Facebook this is maybe also applicable to our case. \footnote{\href{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3216572}{Case of NetzDG}}
