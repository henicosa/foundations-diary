In: Higher Education 18.2 (1989), pp. 239\u2013253. Abstract: This paper presents a new conceptual approach to institutional governance, management, and leadership based upon a cybernetic model of organizations. The cybernetic paradigm integrates existing models by suggesting how bureaucratic, collegial, political, and anarchical subsystems function simultaneously in colleges and universities of all kinds to create self-correcting institutions . The cybernetic paradigm posits that organization control systems can be described in terms of sensing mechanisms and negative feedback loops that collectively monitor changes from acceptable levels of functioning and that activate forces that return institutions to their previous stable state. These self correcting (cybernetic) processes function as institutional \u201cthermostats\u201d. Administrators can function effectively by adopting leadership and management approaches that are consistent with cybernetic principles. These principles suggest that administrators should complicate themselves and use multiple frames to develop richer behavioral repertoires, increase the sensitivity of institutional monitoring systems, and focus attention on important issues through systems that report data and create forums for interaction. The major function of the cybernetic administrator is to coordinate and balance the various systems within the institution to move towards optimizing the administrator\u2019s values. This can be done by making incremental adjustments to administrative processes and procedures, by enunciating goals that establish constraints, and by emphasizing selected elements of organizational life. Birnbaum maps the concepts of cybernetic thinking to a fictional university institution: Huxley College . (p. 240) A thermostat is an example of a self-correcting, cybernetic control system with a feedback loop. It turns the furnace on when the environment's temperature falls below a pre-set limit (say, 70~ and turns it off when the temperature returns to the desired level. This keeps the temperature within an acceptable range. In the same way, Huxley has a number of goals whose achievement must fall within an area of acceptability. If any of them fall outside that range, the energies of individuals or groups at the college are activated in an attempt to return Huxley to the desired level. (p. 241) Birnbaum divides between explicit and implicit controls. Their first function is to keep operations in the university in the acceptable limits by using minor adjustments. The second function is that the minor adjustments initiate actions to inform that something goes wrong.

Nechansky: Elements of a cybernetic epistemology: decisions, control and principles of societal organization Helmut Nechansky. \u201c Elements of a cybernetic epistemology: decisions, control and principles of societal organization \u201d. In: Kybernetes (2008). Abstract: The interaction of goal-oriented systems can lead directly to conflict, cooperation or hierarchy. Out of conflict and cooperation there is a further tendency to develop hierarchies. And in a diversifying environment a hierarchical higher system can grow, get suppressive or perish. It is shown how all this abstract cybernetic reasoning applies to societal organization, too: laws follow the form of decision-rules of feedback systems. Institutions making laws have to define the elements of such decision-rules. And societal organization processes for solving conflicts face exactly the options derived from the interaction of goal-oriented systems. Positive Psychology \u00b6 Seligman: Flourish : a visionary new understanding of happiness and well-being Martin E. P. Seligman. Flourish : a visionary new understanding of happiness and well-being. eng. 1st Free Press hardcover ed. New York: Free Press, 2011. ISBN: 9781439190777. Abstract: Flourish builds on Dr. Seligman\u2019s game-changing work on optimism, motivation, and character to show how to get the most out of life, unveiling an electrifying new theory of what makes a good life \u2014 for individuals, for communities, and for nations. In a fascinating evolution of thought and practice, Flourish refines what Positive Psychology is all about. While certainly a part of well-being, happiness alone doesn\u2019t give life meaning. Seligman now asks, What is it that enables you to cultivate your talents, to build deep, lasting relationships with others, to feel pleasure, and to contribute meaningfully to the world? In a word, what is it that allows you to flourish? \u201cWell-being\u201d takes the stage front and center, and Happiness (or Positive Emotion) becomes one of the five pillars of Positive Psychology, along with Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment\u2014or PERMA, the permanent building blocks for a life of profound fulfillment. Design \u00b6 Senova: This human : how to be the person designing for other people Melis Senova. This human : how to be the person designing for other people. eng. Amsterdam, The Netherlands: BIS publishers, 2017. ISBN: 9789063694609. Abstract: There are many great design books in existence that teach us about design process, tools and methods. With the increasing popularity of design thinking and human-centred design we\u2019ve also seen more material discussing various aspects of the practice.

First, based on a review of the literature, we describe two of the principal performance enhancing benefits of IT: information efficiencies and information synergies, and identify five main organizational outcomes of the application of IT that embody these benefits. We then discuss the role that IT plays in moderating the relationship between organizational characteristics including structure, size, learning, culture, and interorganizational relationships and the most strategic outcomes, organizational efficiency and innovation. Throughout we discuss the limitations and possible negative consequences of the use of IT and close by considering several key areas for future research.

Abstract: This paper explores how values-based innovation (VBI) management can facilitate the development of business models and their constitutive components. It analyses the case of the green search engine, Ecosia, to demonstrate and further differentiate the theoretical framework of VBI management. According to the VBI management framework, the development of sustainable business models cannot be appropriately managed and researched without considering values and normative orientations. Ecosia\u2019s case highlights that the continuous reconsideration and negotiation of values is integral to the management of business model innovation (BMI) and contributes to the development and specification of business model components. Thus, the case confirms and contributes to a more in-depth understanding of the role values play in managing innovation and demonstrates some of the challenges encountered in the daily practice of VBI management.","title":"First Literature Review"},{"location":"Foundations%20of%20Digital%20Media/Project%20Machine%20Assisted%20Governance/#first-literature-review","text":"I made a first Literature Review to grasp the ideas of Machine Assisted Governance In a Second Literature Review and a [[Foundations Draft]]","title":"First Literature Review"},{"location":"Foundations%20of%20Digital%20Media/Project%20Machine%20Assisted%20Governance/#cybernetics","text":"Birnbaum: The cybernetic institution: Toward an integration of governance theories Robert Birnbaum. \u201c The cybernetic institution: Toward an integration of governance theories\u201d. In: Higher Education 18.2 (1989), pp. 239\u2013253. Abstract: This paper presents a new conceptual approach to institutional governance, management, and leadership based upon a cybernetic model of organizations. The cybernetic paradigm integrates existing models by suggesting how bureaucratic, collegial, political, and anarchical subsystems function simultaneously in colleges and universities of all kinds to create self-correcting institutions . The cybernetic paradigm posits that organization control systems can be described in terms of sensing mechanisms and negative feedback loops that collectively monitor changes from acceptable levels of functioning and that activate forces that return institutions to their previous stable state. These self correcting (cybernetic) processes function as institutional \u201cthermostats\u201d. Administrators can function effectively by adopting leadership and management approaches that are consistent with cybernetic principles. These principles suggest that administrators should complicate themselves and use multiple frames to develop richer behavioral repertoires, increase the sensitivity of institutional monitoring systems, and focus attention on important issues through systems that report data and create forums for interaction. The major function of the cybernetic administrator is to coordinate and balance the various systems within the institution to move towards optimizing the administrator\u2019s values. This can be done by making incremental adjustments to administrative processes and procedures, by enunciating goals that establish constraints, and by emphasizing selected elements of organizational life.

Abstract: The Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) represents an innovation in the design of organizations, in its emphasis on computerized rules and contracts, but the DAO\u2019s structures and functions also raise issues of governance. This discussion paper enumerates those issues, so as to encourage further research on DAOs and governance.
